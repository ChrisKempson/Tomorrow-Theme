# Tomorrow Theme

[![Flattr this](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](http://flattr.com/thing/814991/chriskempsontomorrow-theme-on-GitHub)

After having spent over five years using, tweaking and refining a personal editor theme I decided it was time to release "Tomorrow Theme" - a bright theme with pastel colours and sensible syntax highlighting. 

A theme should not get in your way but should aid your programming with easily identifiable colours that add meaning and enhance legibility. This was the main focus when developing Tomorrow. 
=======
# ![Tomorrow Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme/raw/dev/images/logo.png)
Tomorrow is a colour palette comprising of sixteen colours (eight monotone colours and eight accent colours). It has been designed to aid programming by providing easily distinguishable colours that not only enhance legibility but add meaning through grouping common items.
